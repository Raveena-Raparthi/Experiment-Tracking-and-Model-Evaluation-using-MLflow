# Experiment-Tracking-and-Model-Evaluation-using-MLflow
This project explains a simple end-to-end machine learning experimentation workflow using MLflow. The goal of the project is to track multiple machine learning experiments, compare their performance, and select the best model in an organized and reproducible way. The Iris dataset is used along with Logistic Regression models.
